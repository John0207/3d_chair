# 3d_chair
I developed this 3d chair in a graphics course while getting my cs degree. It has lighting, textures, and animation.
You can hold alt and the left button to drag the chair around.
You can also hold alt and the right mouse button to enable using W and S to zoom in and out.
Finally, if you hit 'o' it changes to an orthographic view.
